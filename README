TerepGen - A 3D dynamic terrain generator by Hidvégi Máté

Description:
The program creates a procedurally generated 3D landscape 
which can dynamically be changed with the right mouse button.
With the 'B' key, you can change between adding and erasing ground.

Requirements for building: 
Msvc 12.0 compiler, DirectX11 SDK

How to build:
To build the project, you have to run the terepgen/code/build.bat batch file.
Compiling requires msvc compiler. For the build script to find this, you have to create a 
"terepgen/misc/load_msvc.bat" file with call to the vcvarsall script of the msvc compiler you want to use.
For example load_msvc.bat should contain a similar line:
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x64

After building, the runnable program can be found on the terepgen/build/Debug/terepgen.exe path.

The program was tested with msvc 12.0(VS2013) and msvc 14.0(VS2015) compilers.

Compiling shaders:
Shader compilation happens with the call to terepegen/code/shader/build_shaders.bat script.
The script requires to be given the location of fxc.exe in the script.
Fxc.exe is the shader compiler of DirectX, which can be found in the DirectX SDK.
